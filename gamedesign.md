### Game Design notes ###

Ekans - reverse snake

player must drive a snake in reverse around the playing field eating blobs to reduce snake's length.

Objective of each level - explode the snake by eating a segment such that the head of the snake is eliminated.

Each time a level is complete, the snake gets one segment longer.

User will have 3 snakes 

Points are awarded for each second left in a level
(High score table)
As the levels increase, the snake length increases, until a point is reached (TBD) where the snake stays the same length, but the time per level starts to decrease by 2 seconds per level

***Power-Downs***

These will be called "froots"
they will be random, all look the same but provide different functions.

* Increase Ekans' length by 1
* Increase Ekans' by double the length
* Decrease Ekans' length by 1
* Decrease Ekans' by half the length
* Add 5 seconds to the time available
* Remove 5 seconds from the time available
* Double the time remaining
* Half the time remaining
* Add a random number of segments to Ekans (1 - current length of snake)
* Remove a random number of segments from Ekans' - (1 - current length of snake/2)
* Walls become toxic for a short period
